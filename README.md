# dev_scripts

Scripts to make development and testing workflows easier.

To use the shortcuts as set in the `.commands.sh` folder, add `source ~/dev_scripts/.commands.sh` to your `~/.bashrc` file. This file may need to be created.

Once the commands file is sourced to the bash config file, Mac users should add `source ~/.bashrc` to their `~/.zshrc` file and open a new terminal to enable the commands to be run in zsh.
