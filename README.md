# dev_scripts

Scripts and CLI commands to make development and data analysis workflows more efficient.

All commands are namespaced to `ds:*` so there should be little to no clashing with any existing commands in your local shell environment.

# Installation

To use the shortcuts as set in the `commands.sh` folder, add `source ~/dev_scripts/commands.sh` to your `~/.bashrc` file. This file may need to be created.

Once the commands file is sourced to the bash config file, Mac users should add `source ~/.bashrc` to their `~/.zshrc` file and open a new terminal to enable the commands to be run in zsh.

After installation, start a bash or zsh session and run `ds:commands` to see available commands.
